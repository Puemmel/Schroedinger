**************

Testing the functionality of the solver by using predefined expected values files.
Expected values were calculated for the following cases:

* Unendlich tiefer Potentialkopf
* Endlich tiefer Potentialkopf
* Harmonischer Oszillator
* Doppelter Potentialtopf (linear)
* Doppelter Potentialkopf (nat√ºrlicher kubischer Spline)
* Asymmetrischer Potentialtopf

If calculated expected value is different or reference files are missing,
the pytest will fail.

Plotter

The plotter will automatically visualize the potential, wavefuctions,
expected values of the Local operator and the energies. The user needs 
to execute the schrodinger_plotter.py to do so.
The following files will be used automatically:

* potential.dat
* wavefuncs.dat
* expvalues.dat
* energies.dat

These will be created, if an schrodinger.inp is created according to 
the example (see README oder schrodinger_solver) if the schrondinger_solver.py
is executed beforehand. The result should look similar to the following graphs:
